### Google Forms Automatic File Renamer

#### Manually renaming and organising all the uploaded files from a Google forms response is a hassle and time consuming. This script helps you automatically rename and organise the uploaded files in Google drive based on user response (like their name) or any other criteria and organise them in seperate folders.

#### Note: This is a basic template of Apps Script code, you can alter the code as per your application.
